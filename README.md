# PlusIgniter - CodeIgniter and more.

## Why PlusIgniter

CodeIgniter is very light and powerful framework with small footprint and great performance. But the most critical problem is CodeIgniter's developer have to develop almost the function from the scratch.

But no more. For those who still love CodeIgniter, we bring a good news: For now you can stop reinventing the wheel!!!

PlusIgniter is a module which extend the limitation of CodeIgniter, where you can easily find module, install all the dependencies and get all the control in low, middle and high level.


* Low level: control and use PlusIgniter's module with the smart loader and provided interface. Easily integrate the modules with your application.
* Middle level: feel like a god by controlling and setting everything just by a setting form. No more huge and ridiculous config.php file.
* High level: analytic, cms, webservice and everything you want, you will get right after install the modules. Say goodbye with boring backend development.

## How to start

PlusIgniter is not a new framework. It's just CodeIgniter with small (but smart, lol) library to make it better. Start with same way with CodeIgniter:

* Download or clone PlusIgniter source code. Upload to your web server.
* Config .htaccess, database, route, etc ... just like you do with CodeIgniter.
